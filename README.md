### Work Experience
ASSOCIATE ENGINEER – GENERATIVE AI, VIRTUSA, DLF IT PARK, CHENNAI (Aug’24-Present) Generative - AI Training
• Engaged in advanced training on natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), transformers, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques.
• Contributing to the development of innovative solutions and prototypes by leveraging generative AI, enhancing understanding and implementation of NLP and related technologies.

DATA SCIENCE PROJECT TRAINEE, PDSVISION, IITM RESEARCH PARK, CHENNAI (Aug’23 – Apr’24) Automotive Parts Detection System
• Deployed a real-time object detection system to meticulously verify the presence of all automobile parts within vehicles, significantly enhancing quality control measures within the automotive industry.
• Crafted a tailored dataset for automotive components, focusing on annotation and data preparation, incorporating six specific categories, including cylindrical head, valve assembly, and spring seat washer.
• Trained a YOLOv8 model using the custom dataset, optimising it to achieve a mAP of 0.991.

DATA SCIENCE INTERN, TATA COMMUNICATIONS, JAYANT TECH PARK, CHENNAI (MAY’23- JUL’23) Soccer Event Detection
• Collected and curated a diverse dataset of 500+ soccer match videos, annotating various game events such as goals, fouls, corners, and free kicks, to create a comprehensive training dataset.
• Employed the state-of-the-art EfficientNet-B0 model for multi-class classification of extracted event images, effectively categorizing them into distinct event classes or non-event instances.
• Conducted hyperparameter tuning, improving model performance by 15% over the base model.

### Projects
SATELLITE SHIP SEGMENTATION
• Developed a satellite-based ship segmentation model to fortify maritime security through enhanced monitoring.
• Engineered and processed a run-length encoded dataset to create mask images and delineate ship boundaries.
• Enhanced masks with post-processing and applied U-Net architecture, achieving a Dice coefficient of 0.86.

HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION
• Designed a robust predictive model for house prices utilising sophisticated regression techniques.
• Carried out exploratory data analysis followed by feature engineering for precise house price prediction.
• Executed multiple models, confirming Lasso Regression superiority with a cross-validated RMSE of 0.1121.

CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION
• Created a model to segment customers based on age, income, and spending score for targeted advertising.
• Performed EDA to derive insights and trends, then applied K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation.
• Leveraged the elbow method to find the optimal k and the silhouette score to validate the segmentation.
